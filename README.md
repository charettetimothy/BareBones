## About Big Boned:

Big Boned is a full stack web application. It is an e-commerce website that allows users to browse through a catalogue of available products, add them to there cart and finally checkout.

## Why this app?

You chose Big Boned because you decided to take your health and well being into your own hands. You want the finest products used in the creation of your bone broth, after all you are what you eat.

## Technical Solutions:

Sequelize was used to manage the users login information as well as tracking the products that are available. During testing, the database was hosted locally using MAMP, and it was pushed to Heroku for deployment, with JawsDB providing the SQL database. Bcrypt & passport provided authentication functionality. In addition, Reactootstrap was used for displaying the content onscreen elements such as forms, buttons, and an image carousel. Media queries and Bootstrap classes were used for mobile responsiveness.
